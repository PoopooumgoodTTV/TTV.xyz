        <p>
          I'm Eric, and I've been building websites and web apps for 5+ years
          for great clients all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          More than anything, I like building{" "}
          <strong>
            fast websites that your users love to use and that get results that
            you want
          </strong>
          . It's not just enough to exist any more. Want a higher search
          ranking, more conversions, or more email subscribers? I'll help you
          get there.
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus is on JavaScript development and building sites with React
          and Gatsbyâ€”modern web technologies that won't leave you in the last
          decade of sluggish, cobbled-together websites.
        </p>
